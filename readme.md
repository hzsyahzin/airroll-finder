# Airroll Finder

Finds airroll setups in Dark Souls: Prepare to Die Edition.

Written as an exercise in C. Forgive my bad coding :)

## Usage

Use on command line. Generates a text file with every setup with a given endurance.

```
af [ENDURANCE] [FAP (y/n)]
```

Where `[ENDURANCE]` is the player's endurance and `[FAP]` is whether the ring of favour and protection is equipped.
